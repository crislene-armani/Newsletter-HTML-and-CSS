    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 for sharing documents. It provides special symbols like &copy; for copyright and &reg; for registered trademarks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML 2.0 (1995)</strong> - It was published in 1995</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 3.2 (1997)</strong> - Added tables for layouts</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 4.0 (1999)</strong> - Introduced CSS support for styling</li>
        <li><strong>XHTML (2000)</strong> - Enforced stricter coding rules</li>
        <li><strong>HTML5 (2014)</strong> - transformed the web with native support for multimedia, semantic tags, and APIs, enabling richer, interactive experiences across devices</li>
        </ul>

<article id="css">
    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was created in 1996 by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie to separate content (HTML)from design, allowing for consistent styling across web pages.</p>

<article id="compatibility">
  <h1>Backward compatibility</h1>
    <p> The evolution of HTML and CSS has emphasized backward compatibility, allowing new versions to work with older content and browsers to handle websites built with earlier standards. providing users with a consistent experience while enabling developers to use new features. </p>
 
</article>

<article id="browser">
  <h1>Browsers that support HTML</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Google Chrome</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Safari </strong></li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> </li>
    <li><strong>Opera</strong></li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These browsers continuously update to support new HTML and CSS features, ensuring compatibility and security. </p>

<article id="advantages-desadvantages">
  <h1>Advantages and Desadvantages</h1>
  <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee <br> in late 1991 for sharing documents.</p>
  <h4>Advantages</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> HTML editors provide shortcuts, auto-complete, and templates that speed up coding, especially for repetitive tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Error Detection:</strong> Many editors highlight syntax errors, making it easier to spot and correct mistakes quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Preview Functionality:</strong> Built-in preview modes in some editors let you see live changes, saving time by eliminating the need to switch between editor and browser.</li>
<li><strong>Code Formatting and Organization:</strong> Most editors have auto-formatting tools that help keep code organized and readable.</li>
<li><strong>Customization and Plugins:</strong> Advanced editors offer plugins and themes for added functionality, like integrated CSS preprocessors, making complex workflows easier. </li>

</ul>

<h4>Desadvantages</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dependency on Features:</strong>Relying heavily on auto-complete and shortcuts may reduce manual coding skills over time. </li>
<li><strong>Potential for Code Bloat:</strong>Some editors generate excess or unnecessary code, leading to "code bloat," which can slow down websites.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity for Beginners:</strong> Advanced features may overwhelm beginners, who could benefit more from learning to code without assistance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost for Premium Editors:</strong> Some advanced HTML editors require paid licenses, which may be a barrier for individual or small projects.</li>

</ul>

<article id="scripting">
  <h1>Different Scripting Languages</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Primarily for client-side web development, enabling interactive elements like forms, animations, and dynamic content. </li>
    <li><strong>Python:</strong> Known for server-side scripting, automation, and data science; also popular for web applications with frameworks like Django and Flask. </li>
    <li><strong>PHP:</strong> Usage: Primarily used for server-side scripting in web development, particularly for content-heavy sites (like WordPress).</li>
    <li><strong>Ruby:</strong> Mostly used in web development, particularly with the Ruby on Rails framework, which promotes convention over configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Perl:</strong> Historically popular for web development, text processing, and system administration tasks.</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each scripting language has its niche, with JavaScript excelling in web interactivity, Python in readability and data science, PHP in web servers, Ruby in rapid development, and Perl in system and text processing.</p>
